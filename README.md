# Track-O-Matic
### An autotracker for several emulators that supports all playstyles of DK64R, such as using Spoiler Hints. Contains large sections for hint notetaking as well as showing what levels items have been obtained in.

## Installation
1. You'll need some sort of emulator. Currently this tracker supports Project64, Rosalie's Mupen GUI and Retroarch (including Parallel Launcher).
2. Download the latest release zip from [here.](https://github.com/Brian0255/Track-O-Matic/releases/latest) Extract that to wherever you'd like.
3. Run the executable file and the tracker should begin running correctly.
4. Open your emulator of choice and load up your seed from [](dk64randomizer.com)
5. If you're using spoiler hints, drag the spoiler log that you downloaded onto the tracker. Alternatively, you can click File -> Open Spoiler Log and select it.
6. That's it! You're all set for that seed. If you want to do another one, make sure you click "Reset Tracker" after loading a new ROM.

## User Controls
- Left clicking an item in the bottom area will allow you to drag it to a region. If the item is in a region, left clicking will put it back to the bottom.
- Middle clicking an item, scrolling your wheel OR shift clicking it will **star** it. A starred item will subtract 1 from a region's required check total (if you have that on), so this is very useful when you want to note things that are logically needed.
- Right clicking and dragging an item in the bottom will allow you to place a semi visible item. This is useful for placing an item somewhere when you know it's there and you don't have it yet.
- Left/Right clicking or scrolling your wheel on a region will cycle a region's number forward and backward to help you notate what the level order is.
- Left/Right clicking collectibles (Pearls, Battle Crowns, Blueprints, etc.) will increase/decrease them. **If autotracking is on, these are tracked automatically and will not respond to your inputs as a result.**
- For items in the hint notetaking section, you can shift click or middle click to checkmark them. This is useful when you know hints have been solved for specific items on a path.
- With autotracking on, you really don't have to do much (which is the intention). I heavily recommend it!
