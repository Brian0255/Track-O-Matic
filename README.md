# Track-O-Matic
### An autotracker for Project64 and RMG that supports all playstyles of DK64R, such as using Spoiler Hints. Contains large sections for hint notetaking as well as showing what levels items have been obtained in.

## Installation
1. You'll need some sort of emulator. Currently this tracker supports Project64 and Rosalie's Mupen GUI.
2. Download the latest release zip from [here.](https://github.com/Brian0255/Track-O-Matic/releases/latest) Extract that to wherever you'd like.
3. When you generate a seed, make sure to click "Download Spoiler Log" afterwards.
4. Run the executable file and the tracker should begin running correctly.
5. Open your emulator of choice and load up your seed.
6. Drag the spoiler log that you downloaded onto the tracker if you're using one, or just click File -> Open Spoiler Log and select it.
7. That's it! You're all set for that seed. If you want to do another one, make sure to load a new ROM and then click File -> Reset Tracker.

## User Controls
- Left clicking an item in the bottom area will allow you to drag it to a region. If the item is in a region, left clicking will put it back to the bottom.
- Middle clicking an item or scrolling your wheel on it will **star** it. A starred item will subtract 1 from a region's required check total (if you have that on), so this is very useful when you want to note things that you know are logically needed.
- Right clicking and dragging an item in the bottom will allow you to place a semi visible item. This is useful for if you *think* an item is somewehere but you're not completely sure.
- Left/Right clicking a region will cycle a region's number forward and backward to help you notate what the level orders are. You can also use your mouse wheel to achieve the same effect.
- Left/Right clicking collectibles (Pearls, Battle Crowns, Blueprints, etc.) will increase/decrease them. **If autotracking is on, these are noted automatically and will not respond to your inputs as a result.**
- With autotracking on, you really don't have to do much (which is the intention). I heavily recommend it!
- For items in the hint notetaking section, you can shift click to checkmark them. This is useful when you know hints have been solved for specific items on a path.
